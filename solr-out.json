        "mods_abstract_mt":["<p>For more than three decades now, hiphop and bounce music traditions in New Orleans have been central outlets for creativity, celebration, social critique, community gathering, and political and expressive art in the city. From the groundbreaking, internationally recognized Cash Money and No Limit record labels to the strong currents of underground hiphop and street rap that sustain the tradition, New Orleans has been a recognized hiphop locale since the 1990s. Meanwhile, the indigenous New Orleans bounce music tradition, born at block parties, dance clubs, and other community gatherings, had until very recently been little heard outside the city. Since Hurricane Katrina, bounce has become a force of its own, gaining massive popularity and influence internationally via artists like Big Freedia, Katey Red and Nicky da B (1990-2014), though its roots go back well over two decades.</p>This item is provided by the Tulane University Digital Library: https://digitallibrary.tulane.edu/islandora/object/tulane:p16313coll68"],

          "John Leslie, London correspondent for Panton, Leslie and Company, wrote to John Forbes, a partner in the firm, which was engaged in the Indian trade through Mobile and Pensacola. Leslie discussed the ill effects the renewal of war between England and France had had on British commerce. He repeated the rumors of the terms of the treaty between France and the United States for the cession of the Louisiana territory and gave news of negotiations in Madrid for the cession of the Floridas to the United States. Since the situation had been unsettled, Leslie had suspended business operations until the arrival of James Monroe, the United States Ambassador to England, in July. In an interview with Monroe, Leslie had discussed the future policy of the United States in relation to import through Mobile of British goods destined for the Indian trade. After the interview Leslie had resumed business and began filling the backlog of orders he had received from Forbes. Since Monroe had advised him to send his shipments on American vessels, he had attempted to find a suitable carrier to charter, but ships were available only on hard terms. Consequently, he had decided to use a company-owned boat, the Jean, which would set sail shortly and arrive at Pensacolo around Christmas time. The captain of the Jean had orders to anchor outside the bar of Pensacola, where he would await instructions from Forbes. Leslie advised Forbes and his assistants to become naturalized citizens of the United States in order to facilitate their conduct of business. Leslie gave an account of money received from the sale of pelts that Forbes had sent. He ended dispelling rumors of a possible invasion of England by Napoleon armies."],

          "Spanish colonial officials in Louisiana, as the French before them, enacted regulations governing the operation of inns, taverns, and billiard parlors. The rules were to serve the dual purpose of facilitating the government's task of maintaining public order and at the same time raising revenues through the imposition of license taxes. The documents in this section are annual and quarterly reports made by City Steward Juan de Castanedo of such taxes collected in the 1790s. During this period the impost was 30 pesos a year, paid in quarterly installments, for establishments having no billiard table, 40 pesos annually for those with one table, and 60 pesos for those with two. The names of the license holders making payment appear in the documents. It is interesting to note the increase in revenues collected between 1794 (175 pesos per quarter) and 1799 (566 pesos per quarter). The document dated 1798 December 31 was a report of an annual tax collected on checkerboard and billiard tables set up along the levees of the city. [Additional material on the subject is to be found in: Holmes, \"O'Reilly's Regulations...,\" Louisiana History, VI, 293-300; Holmes, \"Spanish Regulations of Taverns...,\" The Spanish in the Mississippi Valley, J.F.

Arnandez requested that the ten arpents be measured from the southern boundary line, which was adjacent to the property of Amant Hebert. There follow a number of endorsements made by various government officials. On 1799 January 29 Francisco Rivas, [Commandant of the Iberville district], transmitted the petition to the Governor with the certification that the land was unclaimed and that no impediment to granting title existed. On 1802 April 1, the [Intendant] Juan Ventura Morales referred the matter to the Comptroller General [of the Royal Treasury in New Orleans], Gilberto Leonard, who on 1802 May 18 gave his consent that the grant be made, subject to a proper survey conducted by the Surveyor General. Morales, before Carlos Ximenes, [Secretary of the Intendancy], on May 19 added his authorization. Later, Manuel Serrano, [Assesor of the Intendancy], requested that the Commandant of the Royal Treasury ascertain the ages of the applicant's children."],

          "This item contains a signature of Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle (b.1809, d.1885), a German physician, pathologist, and anatomist. His essay, \"On Miasma and Contagia,\" was an early argument for the germ theory of disease. He was an important figure in the development of modern medicine. The progress in science made by Henle depended on the improvements in light microscopy achieved in the 19th century. Henle's work was not confined to the description of anatomic structures. After he had observed microorganisms in the excretions of diseased animals, he embraced the unpopular theory of 'contagion' as the source of infection, though he himself was not able to prove that microorganisms were the direct cause of diseases. He was the chair of anatomy at ZÃ¼rich (1840) and taught anatomy, physiology, and pathology in Heidelberg (1844). He moved to GÃ¶ttingen, and issued his great \"Handbook of Systematic Human Anatomy\", perhaps the most complete and comprehensive at that time. He discovered the loop of Henle and Henle's tubules, two anatomical structures in the kidney. - Acta Med Hist Adriat. 2014;12(2):413-28.

          "Spanish colonial officials in Louisiana, as the French before them, enacted regulations governing the operation of inns, taverns, and billiard parlors. The rules were to serve the dual purpose of facilitating the government's task of maintaining public order and at the same time raising revenues through the imposition of license taxes. The documents in this section are annual and quarterly reports made by City Steward Juan de Castanedo of such taxes collected in the 1790s. During this period the impost was 30 pesos a year, paid in quarterly installments, for establishments having no billiard table, 40 pesos annually for those with one table, and 60 pesos for those with two. The names of the license holders making payment appear in the documents. It is interesting to note the increase in revenues collected between 1794 (175 pesos per quarter) and 1799 (566 pesos per quarter). The document dated 1798 December 31 was a report of an annual tax collected on checkerboard and billiard tables set up along the levees of the city. [Additional material on the subject is to be found in: Holmes, \"O'Reilly's Regulations...,\" Louisiana History, VI, 293-300; Holmes, \"Spanish Regulations of Taverns...,\" The Spanish in the Mississippi Valley, J.F.

The North Americans made four basic demands: 1) that Spain indemnify United States citizens for losses caused during the war with England; 2) that Spain indemnify United States ship-owners for losses caused by French privateers operating out of Spanish ports; 3) that Spain indemnify the United States for losses suffered as a result of Spain's suspension of the right of deposit at New Orleans; 4) that the eastern boundary of the Louisiana Territory be the Perdido River (thus giving the United States title to Spanish West Florida) and that the western boundary be the RÃ­o Bravo (thus giving the United States, Texas and a part of New Spain). Although the King saw some justice in the first claim, he rejected the others [even after Monroe had modified considerably the United States' pretensions]. Soler discussed in detail the Spanish point of view. His Majesty was willing to concede the [present-day] Sabine River as the western boundary, Soler wrote, but Monroe, finding his proposal unacceptable , considered his mission at an end, had requested his passport, and was preparing to leave Spain. Owing to the uncertain situation created by the failure of the negotiations, Soler had ordered the Viceroy of New Spain and the Intendant of Havana to render to Morales whatever assistance he might need for the defense of His Majesty's dominions."],

Lieutenant Francisco Langlois would be second-in-command. Likewise, the captain of each galley would be in command of all men on his vessel. Lieutenant Domingo Bouligny and Josef Zamora would be acting commanders of the Castilla and the Felipa. Upon arrival of La Activa, Rousseau would decide whether to leave Juan BarnÃ³ y Ferrusola in command or to employ his nautical knowledge in some other capacity. All ship commanders were to obey Rousseau's orders. Commandants of military posts along the Mississippi were to render assistance and provide food as necessary. On land, any individual who committed damages against or made extortions of the inhabitants would be punished without mercy. Commanders were to drill their men frequently and to maintain the troops in a state of preparedness. At all posts and forts Squadron Commander Rousseau would remain independent of the local commandant, except at the Natchez post, where he would be subordinate to Governor Manuel Gayoso de Lemos. At New Madrid, the destination of the squadron, military plans were to be formulated, according to private and confidential instructions, by a board, presided over by Thomas Portell, the commander of the post and the senior officer, and composed of Rousseau, Langlois, Zamora, BarnÃ³ y Ferrusola and if present, the commander of the Saint Louis post. A plurality vote would determine the action to be taken.

Striated muscle fine structure began to be really understood following a comprehensive survey of the matter carried out by William Bowman in the late 1830s. He linked the glomeruli to the tubules, described the parietal epithelial cells, the basement membranes, and (with Robert Todd) apparently first identified endothelial cells. His work, \"On the Structure and Use of the Malpighian Bodies of the Kidney\", was awarded the Royal Medal. His collaboration with Todd led to the publication of the five-volume \"Physiological Anatomy and Physiology of Man\" (1843â1856) and \"Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology\" (1852), which detailed their research on microscopy and histology, relating minute anatomical observations to physiological functions.

The possibility of an Anglo-American alliance would be detrimental to both French and Spanish possessions. In the case of Spain, Louisiana and the Floridas could not be defended against an enemy attack. The Louisianians had no love for Spain. The loyalty of the Indian tribes, long Spain's bulwark on the west bank of the Mississippi, was doubtful since Spain had ceded the area to the United States after having promised the Indians never to abandon them. The Americans, on the other hand, would attack Mexico on a moment's notice. Only the French flag planted on the shores of the Mississippi would effectively safeguard against British or American expansionism. The Prince of the Peace, Minister of State Godoy, must be persuaded by these arguments. Also it would be useful to find out from the United States envoy to Madrid the plans of his country's cabinet.

          "[While GenÃªt was intriguing in North America to wrest Louisiana from Spanish control, in France there was a growing movement for the retrocession of Louisiana. Advocates of restoration of Louisiana to French control presented a number of seductive arguments. With a French Louisiana, the French West Indies would be freed of their dependence on the United States for foodstuffs and timber. French ascendancy in the region would be a barrier to American expansion in the west and could provide the necessary leverage to compel the United States to serve the interests of France. French presence would bar British advances and would put France in a position possibly to expand into Spanish America. The documents that follow relate to the retrocession of Louisiana, and the various arguments contained in each are but variations on a theme.] La Gautrais, who claimed to be a spokesman for the inhabitants of Louisiana, demanded their freedom from Spanish rule. The Louisianians were French and wished to belong to the Republic. Louisiana's fertile territory offered great commercial advantages to the Republic. La Gautrais had consecrated his life to the defense and advancement of the Republic and offered, on behalf of the people of Louisiana, to dedicate his efforts to draw them out of their servitude. La Gautrais identified himself, after his signature, as Captain of the 2nd Battalion of the 11th Regiment of the Infantry stationed at Vannes."],

          "[In 1812 June the United States had declared war on Great Britain, and in July of that year General James Wilkinson arrived in New Orleans to take command of the Seventh Military District, which was comprised of Tennessee, Louisiana, and the Mississippi Territory. As protection against the menace of British naval power in the Gulf, he ordered a reconnaissance of the area west of the mouth of the Mississippi and the construction of a new post at La Balize. Ballinger's mission to Barataria, about which he reported in the document summarized below, may not have been strictly for strategic purposes, however, for on 1812 October 12 Governor Claiborne wrote to Wilkinson that the Acting Collector of Revenue of the District had informed him of \"a serious opposition to the Revenue Laws, by an armed Banditti on the Lake Barataria. The Collector, \" Claiborne continued,\" requests Military aid in enforcing the Laws,...and suggests the expediency of your placing the armed force under the Command of Captain Ballenger [sic], who has received a Special Commission as Inspector of the Revenue.\" (Rowland, Claiborne Letterbooks, VI, 189-190).] Captain John Ballinger, having reconnoitered the passes of Barataria and Lafourche, submitted his report to General Wilkinson. With respect to Barataria, vessels not drawing more than three feet of water could come within two leagues of New Orleans. The erection of a fort at a site that he called \"Temple\" would effectively protect against enemy attack. On Bayou Lafourche, which does not connect with Barataria, the most suitable site for a fort would probably be at the fork, where a small detachment of artillery with three six-or nine-pounders could guard the area. Additionally, \"the Creole volunteers would perhaps be the best troops for the Lafourche,\" he said, \"as I consider It a very unhealthy situation.\""],

Supplies were low, however, particularly flour, and Navarro had had to use money from the Treasury to hire ship captains to procure food.

          "King Charles IV, at Aranjuez, issued a Royal Decree concerning the legal status of foundlings in Spain and in the colonies. The reason was his concern for the thousands of abandoned children in his dominions, who yearly perished or suffered ill-treatment, and who because their legitimacy could not be verified, were regarded as bastards or worse. The decree therefore bestowed civil legitimacy upon all foundlings. The King further ordered that the fact of having been an orphan must not be considered a mark of infamy. These children could not be discriminated against in civil matters, and they were to be eligible to attend school, to receive scholarships or legacies, and to hold office. Punishment meted out to a foundling could not be more severe than that given to any other person. The King finally ordered the decree to be incorporated into the laws of Spain and the laws of the Indies and commanded all Royal officials to obey it faithfully."],

          "Spanish colonial officials in Louisiana, as the French before them, enacted regulations governing the operation of inns, taverns, and billiard parlors. The rules were to serve the dual purpose of facilitating the government's task of maintaining public order and at the same time raising revenues through the imposition of license taxes. The documents in this section are annual and quarterly reports made by City Steward Juan de Castanedo of such taxes collected in the 1790s. During this period the impost was 30 pesos a year, paid in quarterly installments, for establishments having no billiard table, 40 pesos annually for those with one table, and 60 pesos for those with two. The names of the license holders making payment appear in the documents. It is interesting to note the increase in revenues collected between 1794 (175 pesos per quarter) and 1799 (566 pesos per quarter). The document dated 1798 December 31 was a report of an annual tax collected on checkerboard and billiard tables set up along the levees of the city. [Additional material on the subject is to be found in: Holmes, \"O'Reilly's Regulations...,\" Louisiana History, VI, 293-300; Holmes, \"Spanish Regulations of Taverns...,\" The Spanish in the Mississippi Valley, J.F.

First, Loyola was to find the principal rules for taking possession in the decree issued by the King. In brief, the following were the major points that Ulloa made: Spanish officials had to follow a just policy in dealing with the greatly devalued paper currency in circulation in the colony; to bring prosperity to the colony the government had to support and encourage agriculture, particularly the cultivation and export of sugarcane, indigo, and tobacco, and the production of food staples for local consumption; French troops in the colony would be allowed to join the Spanish forces on the same footing and pay as the Spanish soldiers; the Capuchins, who under the French ministered to the spiritual needs of the colonists, would continue as before, but they would be joined by two Spanish Capuchins, Father Antonio de Mesones and Father Clemente SaldaÃ±a, and all clergy would receive maintenance from the government; the public hospital, financed by the collection of alms from local residents, would be retained and supported; the military hospital and school for poor orphan girls, both of which the Ursulines administered, would also receive government aid; regarding the administration of justice, the French laws and tribunals would continue unchanged."],

          "The anonymous note proposed steps that France should take to balance the superior strength of the English in the West Indies, as the French Navy was unable to transport troops to the colonies in sufficient numbers. The enlistment of former slaves to fight the British had been unsatisfactory because, the writer said, it was easier to make soldiers out of farmers than vice versa. In recently ceded Santo Domingo the Spanish forces still there could not defend against a British invasion unless Spain had made a declaration of war. France had to seek alliances with the United States and Spain. The former could offer France no assistance in Europe, but it could supply the French Antilles in the event that war with England closed the seas to French shipping. More importantly, the note advised, France should woo Spain from the British coalition in order to renew the traditional alliance with her. Such a rapprochement would be in their mutual interest for, if the French colonies were to fall to the British, those of Spain would follow. Thus the French should persuade the Spanish to declare war on England and to send a strong fleet to the West Indies to fight the British. [Although the Spanish fleet was in need of repairs, it was still one of the largest in the world.] France must send a special agent to Madrid to seek a treaty with Spain. [In August 1796 the two countries signed an offensive and defensive alliance at San Ildefonso. The terms of the pact obliged Spain to declare war on England two months later.]"],

          "Spanish colonial officials in Louisiana, as the French before them, enacted regulations governing the operation of inns, taverns, and billiard parlors. The rules were to serve the dual purpose of facilitating the government's task of maintaining public order and at the same time raising revenues through the imposition of license taxes. The documents in this section are annual and quarterly reports made by City Steward Juan de Castanedo of such taxes collected in the 1790s. During this period the impost was 30 pesos a year, paid in quarterly installments, for establishments having no billiard table, 40 pesos annually for those with one table, and 60 pesos for those with two. The names of the license holders making payment appear in the documents. It is interesting to note the increase in revenues collected between 1794 (175 pesos per quarter) and 1799 (566 pesos per quarter). The document dated 1798 December 31 was a report of an annual tax collected on checkerboard and billiard tables set up along the levees of the city.

The advantages France should secure were: 1) fisheries in Newfoundland and off the coast of Brazil; 2) possessions on the coast of Coromandel [New Zealand] and Malabar [coast of India]; 3) cession of the Isle of Vlissingen, an important military base in the North Sea; 4) Louisiana; 5) the right to establish, for a period of time, a French garrison on the Cape of Good Hope and at Trincomalee [Ceylon].

          "[Brigadier General Victor Collot had been Governor of Guadeloupe at the time of the British capture of the island in 1794 April. He was in Philadelphia in 1796 as a paroled prisoner of war. Adet had arrived in Philadelphia in 1795 June. In his official correspondence he advised the French government to reoccupy and fortify Louisiana as protection against the British threat from Canada and the Gulf and against the westward expansion of the United States. In early 1796 Adet appointed Collot to undertake a reconnaissance of the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys. Ostensibly the study was to be strictly geographical, but secretly Collot was to make political, military, and economic observations as well. Portions of Collot's report were published posthumously in 1826 under the title Voyage dans l'AmÃ©rique septentronale.] Collot's memoir was to be presented to the Ministers of Foreign Relations and of the Navy in France. Collot presented arguments in favor of retrocession of Louisiana. France had sustained a great loss by ceding Louisiana, and she should have insisted upon its return when negotiating the last peace treaty with Spain [Treaty of Basel, 1795]. Had the administrators of the colony under the French been more efficient had the Prime Minister in 1762, the Duc de Choiseul, recognized the potential value of Louisiana, it could today be a recompense for the Republic's loss of her land possessions. The cession of Louisiana had been detrimental to both France and Spain. Its return would give France badly needed timber, naval stores, and foodstuffs. It would enable France to guarantee the Spanish possessions to the south and to balance the influence of the English. Louisiana offered French political and naval power, and through New Orleans it could attract a large part of the United States commerce in the territory drained by the Mississippi."],

The rules were to serve the dual purpose of facilitating the government's task of maintaining public order and at the same time raising revenues through the imposition of license taxes. The documents in this section are annual and quarterly reports made by City Steward Juan de Castanedo of such taxes collected in the 1790s. During this period the impost was 30 pesos a year, paid in quarterly installments, for establishments having no billiard table, 40 pesos annually for those with one table, and 60 pesos for those with two. The names of the license holders making payment appear in the documents. It is interesting to note the increase in revenues collected between 1794 (175 pesos per quarter) and 1799 (566 pesos per quarter). The document dated 1798 December 31 was a report of an annual tax collected on checkerboard and billiard tables set up along the levees of the city.

          "[The outbreak of war between France and Spain in 1793 posed a defense problem for the Governor of Louisiana, the Baron de Carondelet. The Girondist government had sent \"Citizen\" Edmond GenÃªt to the United States to work to wrest Louisiana and the Floridas from Spain. His intrigues resulted in the planning of an attack upon the Louisiana colony by Americans, who were to come down from the Ohio River Valley. At the same time, in the fall of 1793 rumors indicated the strong possibility that a naval expedition would enter the mouth of the Mississippi, sail up the river, and seize New Orleans. These instructions, issued by Carondelet and marked \"Highly Confidential,\" listed precautionary and protective measures to be followed in the event of an invasion, but the threatened attack never took place.] Carondelet informed Colonel Bouligny that he (Carondelet) had to go to Plaquemines, but that he was keeping the trip a secret. He would return by the 24th. Should Bouligny receive news of the enemy's arrival at La Balize, he was to carry out the following instructions: order the detachments at Natchez, Baton Rouge, and GÃ¡lveztown, and the two galleys, to proceed to English Turn; reinforce Fort San Carlos with fifty men; request a detachment to be sent from the German Coast Regiment and dispatch it to English Turn to serve under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Carlos de Grand-Pre; remove the gunpowder from the commercial warehouse and distribute it at Forts San Fernando and San Juan; bivouac the town militia in the Charity Hospital; leave the cannon balls at Fort San Carlos until after the enemy had passed English Turn; enclose the residence of [Gilbert Antoine de Saint] Maxent with a moat and parapet, employing the City Regiment and the Negroes of the town; burn the houses of AndrÃ©s AlmonestÃ©r y Roxas and others downriver from Fort San Carlos should the enemy get past Plaquemines; send the Creek chiefs back to Pensacola happy; order JosÃ© MÃ©ndez to make 100,000 cartridges; instruct JosÃ© Hevia to complete the repair of the galleys as soon as possible. If the enemy approached by way of the Chef Menteur pass, it would be necessary to block the roads with trees and trenches and to surround the area with troops.

          "The Board of Commissioners of the Land Office at Opelousas, after considering the claim of Pierre Arceneaux, reported its findings and rendered a decision. At the same time it set forth guidelines for similar cases. Arceneaux's claim was to a third portion of land on CoulÃ© d'Aigle that Frederick Monton [Mouton?] had purchased on 1802 July 29 for $115 from Achenoya, Chief of the Attakapas Indians. As proof, Arceneaux presented copies of two acts of sale. The Commissioners noted that since the claimant submitted no evidence to establish ownership by occupancy, the claim rested on validity of the Indian title. Thus, they asserted, \"It may not be improper here to enquire whether and how far this case and other similarly circumstanced may be affected by the laws of the United States restraining the purchasing of lands of Indians by unauthorized individuals.\" The Commissioners reviewed the United States laws governing trade and intercourse with Indians. These prohibited the transfer of title of Indian lands except by treaty negotiated by an authorized government official but, until the establishment of the territorial governments in 1804 October, the laws of Spain were in force. The Board proceeded to make a lengthy examination of Spanish laws and their application. The Commissioners perceived four distinct classes of purchases of land from Indians and minutely analyzed each. In the fourth category were lands purchased from non-Christian Indians, who did not occupy them at the date of sale, and which transactions had not been ratified by any Governor of Louisiana. These titles, in the opinion of the Commissioners, ought not to be conferred, \"unless accompanied by some equitable circumstances in their favor.\" The Board concluded, \"Of this last class is the claim at present under consideration, unattended by any circumstances known to the Board of Commissioners, which might entitle it to confirmation.\" [Published in American State Papers Public Lands, V, 736-739.]"],

He would bring immigrants who would receive grants of free land not to exceed 400 square arpents. The limitation would impede the introduction of Negroes and the cultivation of indigo and would foster wheat production. Bastrop also asked permission to export to Havana flour produced at the mills that would be at Ouachita. He requested material support from the government for the colonists to assist them in getting started. Non-Catholics, he continued, should enjoy the same freedoms as those in the Baton Rouge and Natchez districts.

The rules were to serve the dual purpose of facilitating the government's task of maintaining public order and at the same time raising revenues through the imposition of license taxes. The documents in this section are annual and quarterly reports made by City Steward Juan de Castanedo of such taxes collected in the 1790s. During this period the impost was 30 pesos a year, paid in quarterly installments, for establishments having no billiard table, 40 pesos annually for those with one table, and 60 pesos for those with two. The names of the license holders making payment appear in the documents. It is interesting to note the increase in revenues collected between 1794 (175 pesos per quarter) and 1799 (566 pesos per quarter). The document dated 1798 December 31 was a report of an annual tax collected on checkerboard and billiard tables set up along the levees of the city.

The rules were to serve the dual purpose of facilitating the government's task of maintaining public order and at the same time raising revenues through the imposition of license taxes. The documents in this section are annual and quarterly reports made by City Steward Juan de Castanedo of such taxes collected in the 1790s. During this period the impost was 30 pesos a year, paid in quarterly installments, for establishments having no billiard table, 40 pesos annually for those with one table, and 60 pesos for those with two. The names of the license holders making payment appear in the documents. It is interesting to note the increase in revenues collected between 1794 (175 pesos per quarter) and 1799 (566 pesos per quarter). The document dated 1798 December 31 was a report of an annual tax collected on checkerboard and billiard tables set up along the levees of the city.

          "Wharton gave his version of how Joseph E. Johnston came to know of the existence of a written communication addressed by Davis to the Confederate Congress in which Davis had defended his reason for removing Johnston from military command. Wharton had borrowed the only copy in existence from its custodian, Ethelbert Barksdale, and he had privately, and in strictest confidence, read it to several persons. Johnston had probably learned of it from James M. Kennard, secretary to Governor B.G. Humphreys. Although Johnston had alleged that he wanted a copy for use in writing his memoirs, Barksdale had declined to furnish him one. Wharton expressed his continued loyalty to Davis. The Davis-Johnston controversy, he believed, had been flamed not so much by the zealous partisans of Johnston as by Davis' enemies.

This letter to the editor relates to his activities in Washington and was written to refute statements concerning him that were made in letters, published earlier, the first an anonymous piece signed \"A Floridian\" and the second written by Eligius Fromentin. The cataloguer was unable to find copies of any of the letters in the extant newspapers of the period.] [For more complete biographical data on Ballinger see: J.A. Padgett, editor, \"The West Florida Revolution of 1810,\" LHQ, XXI, 93, fn. 63. Concerning his career in Washington see: I.J. Cox, The West Florida Controversy, 598-604. Eligius Fromentin, a Louisiana politician, was elected Secretary of the State Senate in 1812 November and was subsequently elected United States Senator on 1813 January 11. Regarding George Mathews, mentioned below, see: Cox, West Florida Controversy, 310 ff; Ibid., \"...George Mathews,\" MVHR, XII, 309-333.] An anonymous writer, calling himself, \"A Floridian,\" Ballinger wrote, had made certain charges in print against the official conduct of Eligius Fromentin. The writer had cited Ballinger as an authority for proof of the accusation that a memorial to Congress submitted [by certain citizens of West Florida?] had been \"studiously withheld untill [sic] the law of admission had passed.\" Ballinger stated that he had left Washington before the passage of the act of admission [1812 April] and that he had \"had reason to believe the memorial was presented before that time.\" Now, since, Fromentin, rather than seeking Ballinger's disavowal of the anonymous remarks, had made a public explanation of his mission to Washington, Ballinger felt compelled to give his own version. The primary goal of his mission had been to obtain government recognition of West Florida as part of the Louisiana purchase and to secure its annexation to the state that would be formed out of the Territory of Orleans. As his credentials and the Orleans delegation did not arrive in Washington until several weeks after he had gotten there, he was not in a strong position to press his case. Meanwhile, [George] Poindexter [representative of the Mississippi Territory], had promoted the annexation of West Florida to Mississippi and had circulated a petition signed by a number of [West Florida?] residents in support of this move. Although the admission committee had given a favorable report to Poindexter's proposal, Congress had not voted on the measure. Ballinger had made known the position of those he represented to President Madison through Secretary of State Monroe. Subsequently, he had been told by a confidential informant that [General George] Mathews was negotiating with the Spanish commandant at Pensacola, [Vicente Folch], for the surrender of the remaining Spanish posts along the coast, and that Mathews was authorized to hold all of West Florida [from the Mississippi River to the Perdido River] subject to future negotiations with Spain. The lack of journals or other evidence on hand prevented his disproving statements made by Fromentin regarding the favorable committee report on Poindexter's annexation plan."],

          "[Among the tactics conceived by colonial officials in Louisiana to counter the threat of American invasion or seizure of Spanish territories was \"buffer colonization\" - the founding, at strategic sites, of agricultural communities composed of persons loyal to Spain.] [Such was the thinking in 1795 when two would-be colonization impresarios, Joseph, Marquis de Maison Rouge, a French Royalist in exile, and Philippe Enrique Neri, Baron de Bastrop, a Belgian, individually approached Governor Carondelet with schemes to establish European emigrant families in the Ouachita Valley in exchange for grants of vast tracts of land in the area. The planners secured generous concessions from Carondelet, but the results were not what the Spanish expected. Maison Rouge and Bastrop did not fulfill the visionary promises they had made, and the flourishing communities they had projected never materialized.] Governor Carondelet signed an agreement with the Marquis de Maison Rouge, who obligated himself to establish thirty immigrant families in the Ouachita Valley to form an agricultural colony for the cultivation and milling of wheat. The Spanish pledged themselves to provide money and land for the settlers and to pay their transportation expenses. An endorsement, dated 1795 July 14 and signed by Minister of Finance Diego de Gardoqui in Madrid, informed Royal Intendant Francisco Rendon that the King had given his approval to the Maison Rouge grant. [An English translation appears in Mitchell and Calhoun, \"...The Maison Rouge and Bastrop Spanish Land 'Grants',\" LHQ, XX, 303-304; American State Papers Public Lands, III, 409-410, IV, 50-51.]"],

In this digressive statement he justified his participation in the rebellion of 1768 October 29 against Governor Ulloa. He based his arguments on the same premises invoked by his co-defendants: that Ulloa had never exhibited credentials to local authorities and had never taken possession of the colony. In a tone considerably milder than that of the ''Memorial of the Inhabitants and Merchants of Louisiana'' he accused Ulloa of being rude and austere, arbitrary and inflexible. He criticized the Governor for granting commercial privileges to the English, for imposing deleterious trade restrictions, and for refusing to hear citizens' complaints. In summary, Carresse said, Ulloa was a foreigner, a usurper of authority, who had attempted to upset the laws of the Louisianians, to destroy their privileges, and to threaten their liberty. Under the circumstances, the actions of the colony were not criminal. Neither were they clandestine, for Governor Aubry had been kept informed. Finally, Carresse gave his version of Ulloa's expulsion from the colony, describing it as a peaceful departure, for which the citizenry had gathered at the dock where Ulloa's ship was anchored to wish him well. [Carresse was one of the five men executed by O'Reilly on 1769 October 25.]"],

          "Attorney Julien JÃ©rÃ´me Doucet herein offered his own defense to the charges filed against him concerning his part in the rebellion of 1768 October 29. To the accusation that he was coauthor with Pierre Caresse, of the memoir presented to the Superior Council demanding the expulsion of Ulloa and the other Spaniards, he denied having had any part in its writing, although LafrÃ©niÃ¨re and Caresse, under interrogation, had implicated him in the deed. He admitted having assisted with the writing of the ''Memorial of the Inhabitants and Merchants of Louisiana...,'' but he presented a number of arguments to exculpate his participation. He was only drawing up into formal articles, he explained, the generally expressed complaints of the citizenry against Ulloa, and it was not his function to ascertain the veracity of the charges. Furthermore, he was not responsible for additions to his work made afterwards by the printer and others. He presented lengthy justifications for the language used in the memorial. His work, carried out following a request made by the Superior Council eight or nine days after its decree of the 29th, was meant to serve merely as a guide for a delegation going to France. He had not written for publication and distribution. He defended his project to establish a credit bank in the colony as an effort not only completely divorced from the events of the 29th but one that aimed to solve the problems created by the scarcity of specie. He explained how the bank was to have operated. He denied that he armed himself and joined the crowd during the rebellion, but added arguments to excuse his actions should he have done so. He concluded with a summation and a plea for clemency. [The tribunal sentenced Doucet to ten years' imprisonment and barred him from ever returning to Louisiana. O'Reilly ordered him and several of his co-defendants incarcerated in Havana. He remained a prisoner in the Castillo del Morro until he received a pardon from the Crown in 1770 December.]"],

          "Spanish colonial officials in Louisiana, as the French before them, enacted regulations governing the operation of inns, taverns, and billiard parlors. The rules were to serve the dual purpose of facilitating the government's task of maintaining public order and at the same time raising revenues through the imposition of license taxes. The documents in this section are annual and quarterly reports made by City Steward Juan de Castanedo of such taxes collected in the 1790s. During this period the impost was 30 pesos a year, paid in quarterly installments, for establishments having no billiard table, 40 pesos annually for those with one table, and 60 pesos for those with two. The names of the license holders making payment appear in the documents. It is interesting to note the increase in revenues collected between 1794 (175 pesos per quarter) and 1799 (566 pesos per quarter). The document dated 1798 December 31 was a report of an annual tax collected on checkerboard and billiard tables set up along the levees of the city. [Additional material on the subject is to be found in: Holmes, \"O'Reilly's Regulations...,\" Louisiana History, VI, 293-300; Holmes, \"Spanish Regulations of Taverns...,\" The Spanish in the Mississippi Valley, J.F. McDermott, editor, 149-167.]"],

          "Francisco Bouligny wrote to Governor Alejandro O'Reilly to report on his mission to New Orleans and to relate additional information. He left on Friday the 21st at 2 A.M. and proceeded to La Balize. On the way upriver he encountered several vessels, which he described. He arrived in New Orleans on Monday the 24th at 11 P.M. A large crowd gathered as he disembarked. The resident Spanish officials, Loyola, Gayarre, and Navarro, met him and escorted him to the residence of Aubrey, who arose from bed to receive him. Bouligny translated into French O'Reilly's letter to Aubrey. Aubrey then stated that he was prepared to transfer the colony to O'Reilly. The following day Aubrey announced the same to the public. Marquis and LafrÃ©niÃ¨re presented themselves and asked to speak privately with Aubry, and afterwards Aubry informed Bouligny that he had learned that the people were disposed to accept the change and that Marquis and LafrÃ©niÃ¨re wished to go address O'Reilly personally. That evening Bouligny and the three other Spanish officials dined with Aubry. It was a convivial occasion, and Bouligny recounted topics discussed. He reported that earlier, when he rode around the city with Loyola, some persons looked upon them with contempt, but most greeted them in a friendly manner. He did not leave that same day, as the sailors were exhausted and because he wished to keep LafrÃ©niÃ¨re and Marquis under surveillance. Wednesday the 26th, Aubry informed Bouligny that the most experienced captains of the province would accompany him back to O'Reilly's ship to assist in navigating the Spanish fleet up the river. Bouligny assured O'Reilly that he had carried out his instructions to the letter and awaited further orders so as to demonstrate his zeal in the service of His Majesty. He added that he had omitted minor details, which he would convey in person."],

Although during negotiations France had sought to gain Louisiana and other territorial concessions, Spain ceded only Spanish Santo Domingo to the French. Roume, the writer of this letter, had been a French agent in the West Indies. D'Hermand (or, d'Hermand), whom Roume had accompanied to the audience with the Spanish Minister Godoy, was prior to the arrival of the French Ambassador early in 1796, the French Consul General in Madrid and functioned as ChargÃ© d'Affaires. The Spanish Minister of State Manuel de Godoy had been conferred the title \"Prince of the Peace\" by Royal Decree in 1795 September.] Roume reported to Truget on the conversation that he and D'Hermand had had with the Prince of the Peace on the 15th of December at the Escorial. Both men had urged Godoy to allow Roume to depart for Santo Domingo. Godoy had stated that he could not allow Roume to leave until D'Hermand received an answer from the Directory to the observations of the Spanish minister. Much of the frank conversation concerned the exchange of Santo Domingo for Louisiana, which Godoy sought to effect. Roume had informed Godoy that such a trade was prohibited by the constitution of the Republic. Godoy promised to order Roume's reimbursement for expenses he had incurred in Trinidad in the service of Spain. Godoy was anticipating the arrival of an ambassador from France."],

          "Francisco Bouligny, an officer in the Spanish army and envoy for Governor Alejandro O'Reilly, presented a narrative account of the events that took place between 1769 July 20 and August 21 and quoted certain important documents and conversations. He began with a copy of O'Reilly's letter of July 20 to French Governor Charles Aubry. He described the mission on which O'Reilly sent him, traveling from La Balize to New Orleans, his reception in the city, his meeting with Aubry, and his return ship with LafrÃ©niÃ¨re, Marquis, and Milhet, whom the citizens of the colony had chosen as their representatives to meet with the new governor. LafrÃ©niÃ¨re addressed O'Reilly with an oration, recorded by Bouligny as the ''Haranga [i.e., arenga] de seÃ±or LaFreniÃ¨re,'' to assure the Governor of the loyalty of the people. O'Reilly replied in a polite but cryptic manner, which words Bouligny also reproduced. (A French-language version of the exchange appears on pages 6-7 of the document.) Bouligny then described O'Reilly's arrival in New Orleans and the arrest of the ringleaders of the rebellion against Ulloa. At the end he quoted O'Reilly's words of assurance to the merchants of New Orleans and his amnesty proclamation of August 22. [Excerpted in GayarrÃ©, II, 289-308, and in Fortier, I, 209-217.]"],

The Council decided that after the river waters had receded, the residents of Faubourg Marigny would be allowed to take dirt from the batture to fill in the courtyards and land. The Council had received a letter from City Attorney Moreau Lislet in which he advised the City not to change the system of granting licenses to cabarets, inns, cafÃ©s, and billiard parlors. Because the City Treasurer resided in a wooden house exposed to danger of fire, the Council ordered him to deposit city funds in a local bank and to store Treasury records in an office in City Hall. A three-man committee was created to inquire whether some decision of the Superior Court prohibited the removal of hospital patients from the Lavergne house to the building purchased by the City in the town of Clouet. The Council resolved that were it not possible to effect the move immediately, the Mayor should inform Messrs. BarthÃ©lemy and Duverges, tutors to the Lavergne boy, a minor, the henceforth the City would pay only 60 piastres monthly rental for the house, instead of the current 100 piastres."],

When Shannon expressed his disapproval of Lee's behavior and his wish that the police apprehend him, McFarland became angry and Shannon continued, \"afterwards appeared willing by his conversation to alleviate the guilt of Lee.\" The deponent added that he was certain that Lee, who had fled to Thompson's Creek, had heard of the conversation for, through an intermediary, he had informed Shannon that he would seek revenge."],

          "Mayor John Watkins enclosed a list of names of Aldermen elected to the City Council on February 23. He stated that work on the levee in front of Faubourg Marigny was completed at about the estimated cost. Repair work on the levee in front of the meat market was to have been put up for public bids. No action had been taken, but the work could wait until high waters receded. The next section concerned problems encountered in construction of the bayou road. Watkins had taken steps to force Messrs. Michael Smith and S.B. Davis to pay the sum they still owed the City. He had received a letter from Daniel Clark, delegate to Congress from the Territory of Orleans, who informed him that the City's suit claiming title to certain lands was being heard by the Secretary of the Treasury, who would soon render a decision on the matter. The scarcity of ballast this year had hurt local businesses. For this reason the Mayor would allow merchants to borrow ballast from the City on the condition that they return the stones or pay for them. Repairs on the levee facing Faubourg Saint Mary would be very expensive on account of the Council's tax on meats. The Council's decree, which exempted firemen from militia duty, was not approved by the Governor, but it would be incorporated into the militia bill before the Legislature. The previous day a piece of burning charcoal from a fireplace had ignited the floorboards of the chambers of the Superior Court. Luckily the fire was discovered and extinguished before it had done much damage. Watkins suggested that in the future the City should place metal fire screens in front of all the open fireplaces in City Hall."],
